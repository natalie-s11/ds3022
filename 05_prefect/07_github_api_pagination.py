"""
Work with Claude Code (CC) to complete this prefect flow.

The best way to do this is to open CC in the root dir of this
project, and your prompt can reference @05_prefect/07_github_api_pagination.py
to ask for a plan for how to complete the steps. the instructors
inline comments already add to the prompt - i.e. to paginate over that
API endpoint for a certain number of pages, and to store the output
in a single duckdb table. Ask CC to enumerate the steps you will need
to do this, and REQUIRE it to work with you on each task, one by one.

Read what CC generates/suggests with each step, and ask yourself if you
understand the python it has generated. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT WELL,
this is your chance to learn a bit more python! Ask CC to explain the specific
lines that are unclear to you, and have a back and forth with CC until you
get a sense for what is going on. You know about loops, and you know about
fetching remote web content, and so the growth here is understanding how
to cycle through a series of related links to build up all 1000 records.
